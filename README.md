# Gestuelle - Dynamic Hand Gesture Recognition System For Windows

This is a windows application which will enable you to control different applications. The system originally built wiht .NET 3.5 and windows 7 operating system.

This worked with my windows xp, not sure whether it is working with current windows version and .NET 4.5 onwards.

Still you can reuse the components like building the HMM and having the understanding of the moelling, training and using HMM.
